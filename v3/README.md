# NEAT Trader Bot

## Changes
- Now calculating the verst score trader, based on total score


## Performance

- **Average Returns**: The bot typically achieves average returns between 30-40% over a period of 2 years.
- **Learning Curve**: it is getting to higher scores in a less than 5 generations.
- **Stagnation**: when it finds a new optimal score, it will stagnate for some time. Must reduce this.
- **Best Performance**: It is getting scores greater to 50% more often and sometimes it gets to over 60%.

## TODO
- Make it that the best trader is the one with the best "total score".
