Im building a neat trader. The intention is that is able to learn a buy low and sell high strategy. I dont want it to opt for a safe or non risky strategy, where it tries to do a lot of trades at low and then many trades at high. I need kind of it to be risky, so that i dont pay lots of fees. Also, dont want it to learn lean a buy and hold strategy, it should learn to trade and move, to profit. I want to be very strict with genes that are not making any returns or are not moving, I need them to disappear; I also dont want genes to plateau and stay on a safe reward positions, i need them to push to make even better strategies and push to as much returns as possible, then consider this for the training function. Please help me fix this code. Write the whole code of the files that you are fixing(the whole code of the files to modify). Is currently not making rewards and it is profiting models that are not doing any profit at the end, please fix this.
